# Othello Computer Opponent : Haskell

## Final project in CS340: Programming Paradigms and Patterns.
#### Modeled a game of my choice against a computer controlled component using a  minimax algorithm.
#### I chose Othello because its has relatively complex game state changes and depth, but also well researched heuristics to improve the minimax algorithm.
